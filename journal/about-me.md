excerpt: something about me

---

Shushma Gupta makes paintings, drawings and mixed media artworks.
By applying abstraction, Shushma tries to develop forms that do
not follow logical criteria, but are based only on subjective
associations and formal parallels, which incite the viewer to make
new personal associations.

Her works reference nature, spirituality, and inspirations from 
everyday life. Shushma currently lives and works in Mumbai.
